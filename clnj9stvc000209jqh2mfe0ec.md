Algorithms and artificial intelligence have increasingly become a part of our everyday lives. They help us choose music, provide movie recommendations, and even manage traffic signal adjustments. However, what happens when these algorithms enter decision-making processes that affect people's lives and well-being?

Algorithms are mathematical instructions or rules that guide actions towards achieving a specific goal. When coupled with artificial intelligence, they can analyze vast amounts of data and make decisions based on complex rules. This can be beneficial, for example, for insurance companies that use algorithms to make automatic insurance decisions.

But what happens when these algorithms can lead to discrimination? Discrimination can arise from various factors, such as erroneous training data or poorly chosen predictive variables. For instance, an algorithm might end up making discriminatory decisions based on age, language, or gender.

According to the Finnish Equality Ombudsman Tiina Valonen, the discrimination resulting from the use of artificial intelligence, especially in algorithmic automated decision-making, can stem from various factors: errors or deficiencies in training data, poorly chosen predictive variables or sorting criteria, or the algorithm being explicitly designed to give significance to discrimination factors such as age, language, or gender. \[Reference: Tiina Valonen, Head Senior Specialist - [Link](https://syrjinta.fi/en/-/did-you-know-that-discrimination-related-to-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence-and-algorithms-is-supervised-by-the-non-discrimination-ombudsman-1) (Finnish article)\]

This raises questions about whether it is fair for low-income individuals to be denied insurance or be charged more due to their difficulties. Is it fair that loans are not granted to remote areas based on algorithmic predictions?

However, it's essential to note that discrimination doesn't always stem from the algorithms themselves. It can also result from errors or gaps in training data or the incorrect selection of variables. Thus, it is always the responsibility of humans to ensure that artificial intelligence does not lead to discrimination.

Finnish equality laws prohibit discrimination and also apply to the use of artificial intelligence. Discrimination criteria can vary and may relate to factors like place of residence or social status. In Finland, gender-based discrimination is prohibited by gender equality laws. The AI act of the European Parliament has also identified in the category "Unacceptable risk" e.g. Social scoring: classifying people based on behavior, socioeconomic status, or personal characteristics" (source: European Parliament, [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence)).

In conclusion, is it right to grant companies the authority to choose their customers and set their prices? This is a complex question that requires careful consideration. Nonetheless, businesses must adhere to the law and ensure that their decision-making is fair and non-discriminatory.

Algorithms and artificial intelligence can be powerful tools in decision-making, but their use comes with risks. It is essential that we take these risks seriously and ensure that technology serves society in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.
